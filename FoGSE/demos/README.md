# GSE Demo Folder

This folder contains demos for the FOXSI-4 GSE:

* Run `python demo_single_existing_cdte.py` to step through an existing CdTe detector data file and display images and spectrograms.
* Run `python demo_single_live_cdte.py` to read from a currently writing CdTe detector data file and display images and spectrograms.
* Run `python demo_fake_rtd.py` to generate fake RTD data while plotting the new data being written to the generated file.
* Run `python demo_existing_rtd.py` to step through an existing RTD data file and display time profiles.
* Run `python demo_live_rtd.py` to read from a currently writing RTD data file and display time profiles.

This folder contains stand-alone demo examples of the basic GUI creation for each data source expected for FOXSI-4 that will be combined for the full GSE.
